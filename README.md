# FLoop-Habit-Tracker
A Flutter clone of the popular [Loop Habit Tracker](https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits).  
**This is NOT a 1:1 clone** there are differences in the UI and how data is stored and handled

## Motivation

- I loved using Loop Habit Tracker, but found it frustrating that habits couldn‚Äôt sync between devices or platforms‚Äîeach phone kept its own data. 
- I decided to build this Flutter version to explore cross-platform development and to lay the groundwork for future synchronization features.
- Although sync isn‚Äôt implemented yet, you can already access the raw data file on Android (`/storage/emulated/0/habits.json`) and sync it manually (for example, via termux with a git server, Tasker, python/bash script,).
- You can open `habit.json` in any text editor and make changes ‚Äî they will be reflected in the app. 
- This project began as a college assignment and quickly became my personal playground for learning Flutter and mobile architecture.
- It‚Äôs still in its early (alpha) stages.

---

## Roadmap
- [ ] Sync habits across devices (OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive)
- [ ] Support for other platforms (ios, desktop, web)
- [ ] Custom reminders & notifications
- [ ] Adding more visualizations
- [ ] Publish to Google Play & App Store
- [ ] Importing Loop habit tracker data via csv
- [ ] Fixing theme and optmizing/refactoring code
- [ ] and many more :)
